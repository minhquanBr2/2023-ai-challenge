i'm drunk in the back of the car and i cried like a baby coming home from the bar said i'm fine but it wasn't true i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you and i snucked in through the garden gate every night that summer just to steal my fate oh and i screamed for whatever it's worth i love you ain't that the worst thing you've ever heard
